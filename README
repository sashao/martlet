GIT COMMANDS:

Git config:
	$ git config branch.autosetupmerge true

Tells git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull(1)
will appropriately merge from that remote branch. Recommended. Without this,
you will have to add –track to your branch command or manually merge remote
tracking branches with “fetch” and then “merge”.

-----------------------------------------------------------
~/.gitconfig file
-----------------------------------------------------------
[color]
	diff = auto
	status = auto
	branch = auto
[user]
	name = Oleksandr Omelchuk
	email = sashao@e-mail.ua
[branch]
	autosetupmerge = true
-----------------------------------------------------------


Roll back:
	$ git checkout A2 -- .  
	$ git commit -m 'going back to A2'

Create remote branch:
	is easier to first create the branch locally and then push it to the remote repo:
	
	$ git checkout -b new_feature_name
	$ git push origin new_feature_name
