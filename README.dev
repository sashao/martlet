Let it be our slogan:

A programmer's instinct is to maximize the available options. 
A well designed tool or interface is about simplicity, responsiveness and a minimum of keystrokes.

Coding standarts:

* No warnings or build errors should be introduced.
* Tab size = 4, use spaces instead tabs.
* Doxygen comments for new classes / members.
